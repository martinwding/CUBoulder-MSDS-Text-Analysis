# CUBoulder-MSDS-Text-Analysis

The projects here demonstrate the application of using the powerful ktrain library for performing text analysis tasks.

ktrain is a lightweight wrapper for the deep learning library TensorFlow Keras (and other libraries) to help build, train, and deploy neural networks and other machine learning models.
